13. F:  we should add it to the Bird class because all bird subclasses inherit from the Bird class
14. F:  we should add it to the Animal class because all animal classes inherit from the Animal class

9. F: You cannot add a horse to a list of dogs because they are of different types. The dogs list is specifically defined to hold instances of the Dog class, and a horse is not a dog

10. F: To store all classes together, the list type should be a common base class or interface that all classes inherit from or implement. In this case, since all classes inherit from the Animal class, you can use a list of Animal objects.
